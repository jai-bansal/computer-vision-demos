## image-rec-custom-class

### Summary:
Add custom classes to open source image recognition models.

### Motivation:
Learn to extend open source image recognition models to custom classes.

### Data: 
Data comes from the "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset from Kaggle.com.
To keep things easy, I only use 100 images for the training and validation sets for each class.

The data can be found at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats

### Method:
I attempt to identify 2 custom classes: cats and dogs.

The general strategy is to use an open-source image recognition model without the last layer.
I run the new data through this almost-complete model and use the outputs as the input for a 
new, small neural network.

I use 2 open source image recogntion models:
- Xception
- InceptionV3

This project doesn't include any parameter tuning, it just gets things running as fast as possible.

### Files

- 'data' folder
   - 'train' folder
      - 'cat' folder: contains training images of cats
      - 'dog' folder: contains training images of dogs
   - 'validation' folder
      - 'cat' folder: contains validation set images of cats
      - 'dog' folder: contains validation set images of dogs
- 'weights' folder: initially just contains a placeholder text file but must contain the weights file for the image rec models above for the script to run
- 'add_custom_class.py': trains a model to identify custom classes of dogs and cats
